↓↓↓ Create a cool harmless prank computer virus with VBScript!!! ↓↓↓
   --------------------------------------------------------------

1. Install
--- ↓↓↓ Install a text editor such as Visual Studio Code ↓↓↓
------- https://code.visualstudio.com
--- Copy and paste link in the browser and install
--- If you already have a text editor installed, move on!

2. Create a new file
--- Create a new file by pressing File > New file... (depends on the text editing program)
--- Name it anything you want, but make sure it has a .vbs (VBScript) extension

3. Copy and paste
--- ↓↓↓ In the text editor copy and paste this piece of code ↓↓↓
------- X = MsgBox("Text", 0+16, "Title")

4. Customize text
--- Rename "Text" with something else, such as "This is a harmless prank virus!!!"
--- Rename "Title" with something else, like "Windows"

5. Customize Buttons
--- Replace 0 with one of these numbers ↓↓↓

------- 0: OK Button
------- 1: OK and Cancel Button
------- 2: Abort, Retry and Ignore Button
------- 3: Yes, No and Cancel Button
------- 4: Yes and No Button
------- 5: Retry and Cancel Button

------- Changing the number will change the button(s)

6. Customize Icon
--- Replace 16 with one of these numbers ↓↓↓

------- 16: Critical Icon
------- 32: Help Icon
------- 48: Warning Icon
------- 64: Information Icon

------- Changing the number will change the icon

7. Loop (Optional)
--- Instead of just pasting "X = MsgBox("Text", 0+16, "Title")" right into the text you can first write:

do

loop

--- Then paste "X = MsgBox("Text", 0+16, "Title")" and your window will be looped and unclosable
------- (You can actually close it by opening Task Manager)
------- (This will not cause lag, but is going to make the window unclosable)

8. Spam Boxes (Optional) (Not recommended)
--- You can spam the boxes by doing this:
------- Create a batch file (name the file anything but make sure it has a .bat (Batch) extension)
------- Write:
@echo off
:b
cscript vbscript.vbs
goto b
------- Replace vbscript with the name of your vbscript file
---------- (This might not work, if it does, your computer can start lagging)

9. Save
--- Save your VBScript "virus" as intended by your text editor
--- If you also created the batch file then also save it
------- (If you will not save you might have to start again if you close the editor and opening the file might not do anything)

10. Run
--- You can run the file by opening File Explorer, find your file, double click on it and it will run
--- If you also created the batch file then run the batch file instead
--- To prevent the popup from opening open task manager and end the task, or type "taskkill /f /im vbscript.vbs" in command prompt or "taskkill /f /im batch.bat" in the command prompt
